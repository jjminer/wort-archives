Hrm.  So, it's not unusual to have two sox processes running, one for the
15-minute slices and one for the whole shows.  I guess the plot to stitch
the shows together from 15-minute chunks didn't happen.

Here's where it's hitting the duplication, though:

Given `wort_180618_140002aaj.mp3` and `wort_180618_140007aaj.mp3` from this
afternoon:

```sh
# Build old filename format

OldShowName=$(awk "/^$ShowCode/ {print \$2}" $SHOWDB)

OldDate=$(date +"wort_%y%m%d_%H%M%S")

OldFilename=$(echo "$OldDate$OldShowName")
```

Cron ran at 14:00:00, took 2 seconds (WTF?  Really?  Did we lose a war?) to
get to the line where it calculates OldDate, resulting in 140002.  We can
check the cron logs.

Meanwhile, in order to overcome that the scripts intentionally over-record
by 120s (yay!  No more cut off Mel & Floyd!), autoarchive schedules itself
to run again when the current program is supposed to end using at (not: NOT
running bootstrap_autoarchive, because if it ran that script the new
recording wouldn't start because it looks to see if sox is already running
a "FULL" recording):

```sh
# Get show stop time  from Spinitron to pass to at
ShowStopTime=$($SPINITRON_SCRIPT_DIR/showstoptime)
### [ ... ]
# Schedule next recording - requires at
at -f $ARCHIVE_SCRIPT $ShowStopTime
```

But because for some reason this is happening REALLY SLOWLY, it takes 7s
for this incantation of autoarchive to get running.  This has to have been
at running the command, because the bootstrap script would refuse to run a
second time on top of itself.  Meanwhile, the code in autoarchive that is
meant to avoid this:

```sh
# Build record filename
Filename="FULL - $(date +"%F %H%M") - $(date +"%H%M" -d "+$ShowRunTime
seconds") - $ShowName - $ShowCode - $OldFilename.mp3"
# Test to see if there's already a recording running - if so, quit.
if [ -e "$RECORDING_DIR/$Filename" ]
then
  exit 1
fi
```

Fails because the datestamps in in the file names are 5 seconds apart, so
it's comparing (in this case):

`FULL - 2018-06-18 1400 - 1700 - All Around Jazz - something - wort_180618_14000*2*aaj.mp3`

against

`FULL - 2018-06-18 1400 - 1700 - All Around Jazz - something - wort_180618_14000*7*aaj.mp3`

Which is obviously not going to work.

I like the code in general, though, IMO it's pretty elegant.  Whatever is
causing the slowness in the script is amazing.  I can't believe nobody has
noticed that we're always missing at least 2s at the start of the
recordings.  We can look at cron logs and see if it's starting things late
or if the scripts really take that long.

Looking at the recordings yesterday/today, they are all at least off of
the  hour before the name of the show is computed (line 38 by my count),
usually 2s, occasionally only 1s, but sometimes 7:

   - wort_180618_190007access.mp3
   - wort_180618_180002iobymon.mp3
   - **wort_180618_140007aaj.mp3*
   - **wort_180618_140002aaj.mp3**

   - wort_180617_030002life.mp3
   - wort_180617_000001use.mp3

I don't see any kind of pattern I can make sense of.  Odd that access_hour
didn't record twice, even though it started 7s late.
